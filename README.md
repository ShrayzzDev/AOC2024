# Advent of code 2024

## Things I (sadly) gave up :

- Day 2 Part 2 : Took too long on part 1 for stupid reasons and did not want to spend more time on it.
- Day 3 Part 2 : Gave up bc tired (and had other things to do, it's my bday after all) but may do it later, seems not too hard
- Day 4 : What ? Example given gives 18 with the program, but does not give the right things with the input. Idk why and it's pissing me off. May look back at it later though
